"""
Canonical document representation — the single shared output of PDF processing.

Every downstream consumer (summarization, RAG embedding, clause detection,
entity extraction) reads from these objects. There is exactly one extraction
and one chunking implementation in the codebase; nothing re-parses the PDF.

    CanonicalDocument
        ├── pages[]     — page_number + text, page boundaries preserved
        ├── sections[]  — detected legal structure, may span pages
        └── chunks[]    — token-aware units carrying full source traceability

Page traceability is a product requirement, not a nicety: every chunk records
`page_start`/`page_end` and its section, so a summary sentence can always be
traced back to the page it came from.
